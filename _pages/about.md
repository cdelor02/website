My name is Charlie DeLorey, and I am a Master's student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk). My course is the [MRes in Medical Robotics and Image Guided Intervention](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/study/pg/medicine/medical-robotics/) in the [Hamlyn Centre](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/hamlyn-centre/). An insatiable tinkerer, I love making and learning new things. My academic and professional interests include medical devices, prosthetics, and (soft) robotics. I completed my B.S. in [Computer Science](https://engineering.tufts.edu/cs/) at [Tufts University](https://www.tufts.edu/) in Medford, Massachusetts.
