# Personal website

Here is the repo for my personal website, which is hosted and run using GitHub Pages. Feel free to fork this repo as a barebones website example, it is not currently very complex but I plan on adding more features and style to make it more enjoyable to read. 


### Major Edit History:

- 09/22/2022: the website is being built from the [`bilingual`](https://github.com/cdelor02/website/tree/bilingual) branch of this repository. This is to experiment with my knowledge of HTML/CSS as well as exercise my French language skills. I apologize for any grammatical or vocabulary errors I make, and strive to improve those as well as the readability of my website in due course.
