    Led two lectures with ~40 students each on the history and state-of-the-art of medical technologies. Starting from the Ancient Egyptians up to important discoveries in the 
  19th and 20th centuries, all the way to modern day devices and techniques. I also gave some examples of very recent academic papers exploring some more experimental 
  designs and ideas, not yet developed into products. At the end I left time for a Q&A section for students to ask me their questions and clarifications.</p>

    Undergraduate teaching assistant for graduate-level course in programming languages. I held weekly office hours to assist students in understanding key course concepts, 
    navigating proofs, and facilitating their understanding of the material through their weekly homework assignments. I also joined the teaching staff in a weekly homework grading 
    meeting, as well as meetings to grade exams.

    Led two lectures with ~50 students each on the history and philisophical themes found in the science fiction genre. Beginning with the literary birth of the genre 
    (Mary Shelly's <i>Frankenstein</i>) and the reflection of society at the time in films such as <i>Forbidden Planet </i> and <i>The Day The Earth Stood Still</i>. I incorporated 
    an exercise for the students to consider a fictional planet of their own, and begin to think as sci-fi writers making a single change to a "normal" world and seeing what that 
    would entail (ex: a planet with corrosive acid rain; what would umbrellas be like? What about the water supply? Is there a way to use this acid rain to an advantage?)
