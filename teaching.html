    Led two lectures of 15 students each (on average) on the history and state-of-the-art of medical technologies. Starting from the Ancient Egyptians up to important discoveries in the 
  19th and 20th centuries, all the way to modern day devices and techniques. Gave examples of recent academic papers exploring some more experimental 
  designs and ideas, not yet developed into products. Ended course with Q&A section for students to ask me their questions and clarifications.</p>

    Undergraduate teaching assistant for graduate-level course in programming languages. I held weekly office hours to assist students in understanding key course concepts, 
    navigating proofs, and facilitating their understanding of the material through their weekly homework assignments. I also joined the teaching staff in a weekly homework grading 
    meeting, as well as meetings to grade exams.

  <p> 
    Led two lectures with ~50 students each on the history and philisophical themes found in the science fiction genre. Beginning with the literary birth of the genre 
    (Mary Shelly's <i>Frankenstein</i>) and the reflection of society at the time in films such as <i>Forbidden Planet </i> and <i>The Day The Earth Stood Still</i>. I incorporated 
    an exercise for the students to consider a fictional planet of their own, and begin to think as sci-fi writers making a single change to a "normal" world and seeing what that 
    would entail (ex: a planet with corrosive acid rain; what would umbrellas be like? What about the water supply? Is there a way to use this acid rain to an advantage?)
