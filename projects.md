# Projects

Here are a number of projects I've done


## MRes Thesis project: Soft robot actuator with integrated shape sensing via electrical impedance tomography (EIT)

  Supervisors: Drs. James Avery, Mark Runciman, Saina Akhond, George Mylonas
  The Hamlyn Centre, Imperial College London
  
  This project entailed an extensive literature review in the field of soft robots, control systems, and uses of EIT in robotics. Next, simulations using EIT simulation software EIDORS () were done to evaluate optimal placement of electrodes necessary for sensing along the body of the hypothetical robotic actuator. In tandem, multiple iterations of actuators were devised and tested, starting from 3D-printed actuators operated by hydraulics to silicone moulded cable-driven actuation. The latter was retained and outfitted with a sensing chamber filled with saline solution, this being the site of sensor data production.
